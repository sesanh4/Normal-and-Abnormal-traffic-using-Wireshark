# Abnormal-traffic-using-Wireshark
This discussion covered using Wireshark, Nmap, and Hping3 to analyze normal and abnormal network traffic, including TCP handshakes, SYN scans, and DoS simulations. Observing TCP resets, floods, and ICMP traffic helps identify vulnerabilities and test defenses. Such testing requires caution to avoid legal or ethical issues.
